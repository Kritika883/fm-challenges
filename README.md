During coding, several challenges may arise. First, an undefined error may occur if g.style.display = 'none'; is used without properly defining g, leading to runtime issues. Handling edge cases in calculations is also crucial, as division by zero, invalid inputs, or floating-point precision errors can cause incorrect results. The reset function may not clear all values properly, especially if UI elements like active tip buttons are not reset correctly. Managing the active state of tip buttons can also be tricky, as selecting a new tip should deactivate the previous selection. Additionally, error messages must be displayed and hidden correctly to ensure a smooth user experience. Debugging and testing for these issues are essential for a fully functional and user-friendlyÂ application.
